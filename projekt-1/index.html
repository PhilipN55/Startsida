            <p class="p1">SCP-049 is a humanoid entity resembling a medieval plague doctor, complete with robes and a bird-like mask that are actually part of its body. It speaks fluent English (and occasionally French) with an old-fashioned accent.<br> SCP-049 believes humanity is afflicted by something it calls “The Pestilence.” When it encounters someone it deems “infected,” it will attempt to perform a “cure” — first by killing the subject with a single touch, and then conducting crude surgery using tools it produces from its robes. After the procedure, the subject is reanimated as an aggressive, zombie-like creature devoid of higher brain function.</p>
            <p class="p2">SCP-914, known as “The Clockworks,” is a massive clockwork machine built of brass and steel, with two chambers labeled “Input” and “Output.” Despite its size and complexity, it operates with perfect precision and no identifiable power source. When an item is placed inside and a setting is selected on its central dial, the machine refines or alters the object depending on the chosen mode — from “Rough” and “Coarse,” which degrade materials, to “Fine” and “Very Fine,” which improve or transform them in unpredictable ways. Its effects are not limited to physical changes; abstract properties can also be affected. Testing on living subjects is prohibited due to severe and unpredictable results.</p>
