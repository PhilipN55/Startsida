        <div class="box"> <p class="p1">SCP-049 is a humanoid entity resembling a medieval plague doctor, complete with robes and a bird-like mask that are actually part of its body. It speaks fluent English (and occasionally French) with an old-fashioned accent.</p><p class="p1"> SCP-049 believes humanity is afflicted by something it calls “The Pestilence.” When it encounters someone it deems “infected,” it will attempt to perform a “cure” — first by killing the subject with a single touch, and then conducting crude surgery using tools it produces from its robes. After the procedure, the subject is reanimated as an aggressive, zombie-like creature devoid of higher brain function.</p></div>
